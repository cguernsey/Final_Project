Final Project - JHU EN.640.635

Cam & Cam's Harbor Bike Rentals

Team Members: Cameron Carter & Cameron Guernsey

This project consists of a single python code: Bike_Rental_System.py.
This python code creates a system that resembles the functionality of a bike rental system.
The rental system allows users to create accounts and login to what would likely be a mobile app.
Users are then able to rent and return bikes similar to the service Bird and Lime offer with electric scooter rentals.
The code will document the real time that users rent a bike and charge the user based on a price per time basis.
The python code is based on the main User class that tracks user attributes, including name, username, password, rental status, bike rented, and the user's personal encryption key.
A list of bikes also exists to track the bikes in the system and which bikes are available for rent.
There are several functions that mirror the actions users can take within the rental system.
For example, a user can create an account, login to their account, rent a bike, return a bike, all based on their input to the terminal.
There are also other functions that are not as visible, which allows users to create and encrypt their own passwords with randomly generated personalized keys.
Error handling has been implemented to return users to main screens or previous functions/actions if their input is invalid.
