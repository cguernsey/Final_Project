Final Project - JHU EN.640.635

Cam & Cam's Harbor Bike Rentals

Team Members: Cameron Carter & Cameron Guernsey

This project consists of a single python code: Final_Project.py.
This python code creates a system that resembles the functionality of a bike rental system.
The rental system allows users to create accounts and login to what would likely be a mobile app.
Users are then able to rent and return bikes similar to how Bird or Lime offer an electric scooter rental system.
The code will document the real time that users rent a bike and charge the user based on a price per time basis.
The python code is based primarily on two main classes: a user class and a bike class, each with their own attributes.
There are several functions that mirror the actions users can take within the rental system app.
For example, a user can create an account, login to their account, rent a bike, return a bike, all based on their input.
There are also other functions that are not as visible, which allows users to create and encrypt their own passwords with randomly generated personalized keys.
Error handling has been implemented to return users to main screens or previous functions/actions if their input is invalid.
